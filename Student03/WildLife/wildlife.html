With an estimated 5000–7500 elephants, Sri Lanka is home to the biggest population of Asian elephants.The largest brain of any terrestrial mammal in the world can be found in these highly clever creatures. In the past, kings maintained those creatures for both military needs and as a symbol of their regal status.The population of Sri Lankan elephants is confined to dry areas in the country's northeast, east, and southeast.A mature elephant can eat 300 pounds of vegitations in a single day.</p>

Very big males can reach up to 77 kg. Adult females are significantly smaller, about 32 kg. The estimated number of leopards currently inhabiting Sri Lanka is 600 or 700 individuals.This means, leopards occur in all three major climate and vegetation zones of the island: The highest numbers of Sri Lanka leopards can be found in the dry zone, where almost all wildlife parks are situated. Due to the lack of tigers and lions on the island, leopard are Sri Lanka’s top predator.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    The first stop on your journey to the park will likely be at Tissamaharama, a town in the Hambantota district that acts as a gateway to Yala. Here is where a majority of safari drivers pick up eager safari enthusiasts – try to book your trip in advance so that you can avoid having to bargain with safari guides at the last-minute.<br>
        
                                    <br>From Tissamaharama, your journey continues a further 20 kilometres (approximately 30 mins away) to Palatupana, where a visitor centre is available to provide information for tourists and assign trackers to the safari vehicles. The costs of the safari are easier to manage between several people, so try and travel with friends. From here, you hop into your safari jeep and head off!</p>

                            <p>Yala National Park contains five blocks, with the two south-eastern coastal blocks being the most frequently visited by the public. The park is also connected to adjoining wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, the largest of which is the Lunugamvehera National Park. Overall, Yala covers an area of 979 square kilometres that hosts a variety of different ecosystems, ranging from jungles to freshwater wetlands, that makes it an ideal home for several species of wildlife.<br>
                                Yala is home to more than 200 species of birds and 40 species of mammals, but it is probably most well-known for its leopard population. There are more leopards per unit of land in Yala than almost anywhere else in the world, and the park is considered to have far more leopards sightings than any other national park on the island. It is best to visit between January and July to increase your chances of spotting these magnificent creatures.<br>
        
                                <br>Elephants can also be spotted at Yala, but the possibility of sighting them varies throughout the season. This is because Lunugamvehera National Park acts as a natural corridor between Yala and Udawalawe National Park, which the elephants use to move between habitats. Your best chance of spotting them is during the dry season, between May and August.<br>
                                
                                <br>Yala is also home to crocodiles, peacocks, monkeys, sloth bears, water buffalo, wild boar, deer and golden jackals. Around 130 different species of birds have also been recorded in the park, including pelicans, storks, herons and flamingos.<br>

However, the forest expands over the territories of three districts. A prominent fraction of the forest reserve, which is equal to 60 per cent of the total land area, is contained within the borders of the Rathnapura District. The rest is included in the districts of Galle and Kalutara, in equal portions of 20 per cent.<br>
                                <br> There are multiple points of entrance to the forest, based on the route you are taking. If you are reaching from the Western or the Northern parts of the country, the forest can be accessed via Ratnapura, Kiriella, Kalawana and Weddala. Nonetheless, if you are coming from the Southern part, Deniyaya would be the most accessible. Also, if it is from Hambantota, Udawalawe region, you can enter the forest from the Rakwana side.<br></p>

According to a study carried out on the mixed species bird flocks, 42 individual birds occur in the flocks on average which makes this the world’s largest mixed species bird flock. The mixed species Bird flock study of Sinharaja forest has been continuing since 1981 and is considered as the World’s longest bird flock study<br>

In fact 95% of the endemic birds of Sri Lanka are recorded in Sinharaja. Endemism among mammals and butterflies are also greater than 50% Out of the larger mammals, although elephants were said to be ‘common’ in the past, there have not been reports of sightings during the last 15 years. However, there have been reports of sightings of a few animals in the Eastem Scctor. <br> </P>
