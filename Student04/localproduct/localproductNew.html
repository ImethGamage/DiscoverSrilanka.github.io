                        <p>Ceylon tea has origins in Sri Lanka, which, prior to 1972, was called Ceylon. White says it's often regarded as one the best black teas on the market, although Seidler says it can be made with other tea leaves as well.
    
                            "The tea is produced using either black tea leaves, green tea leaves, or white tea leaves from the Camellia sinensis plant," says Seidler. White points out that Sri Lanka has very diverse orographic and climatic conditions within the country. Its seven main tea cultivating areas include Nuwara Eliya, Uva, Kandy, Dimbula, Ruhuna, Uda Pussellawa, and Sabaragamuwa.
